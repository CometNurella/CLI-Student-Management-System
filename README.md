# CLI-Student-Management-System
Taken inspiration from https://github.com/Code-Recursion/Student-Record-Management-System.git
The "Update" and "Add" functions from the original repository will become one function named "Add" to avoid confusion
Although this is just a cheap knockoff lol. I haven't learnt GUI yet and OpenGL doesn't read from external files.
